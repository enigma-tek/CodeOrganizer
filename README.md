# PSCodeOrganizer
Web based PowerShell driven, PowerShell and KQL organizer.
There are a lot of ways to store PowerShell scripts and code snippets, with the ability to make comments, version numbers, compatability, etc. You can use GitHub, a folder with files, a wiki, etc. With all of these options we have not come across a free product that allows for a person or team to store and manage PowerShell that checks all the boxs for creating an organized managed system.

The idea behind PSCodeOrganizer is to have an easy to use, easy to search and easy to read site running locally(for your own repo) or available for a team to use. There are 2 editions so please choose correctly when installing. If you want your own local repo or just want to demo the tool, choose the "local" version. If you have decided to use it for more people or a team of people, choose the "team" version. The difference is that the local version runs using localhost and a port number and the team version will run using a DNS name and will require an SSL certificate. 

There is no method of, or will ever be added the ability to store or use passwords or credentials in this tool. You should never, EVER, store passwords or credentials in a script itself. There are many ways to pass that information into a script at run time. You have been warned.

This tool is a repository only. You cannot run the code stored here from the site itself.
