# PSCodeOrganizer
Web based PowerShell driven, PowerShell and KQL organizer.
There are a lot of ways to store PowerShell scripts and code snippets, with the ability to make comments, version numbers, compatability, etc. You can use GitHub, a folder with files, a wiki, etc. With all of these options we have not come across a free product that allows for a team to store and manage PowerShell that checks all the boxs for creating an organized managed system.
