# Code Organizer
Pode.Web driven web portal for organizing PowerShell, PowerShell Snippets, KQL, SQL and frequently used Commands.
There are a lot of ways to store PowerShell scripts and code snippets, with the ability to make comments, version numbers, compatability, etc. You can use GitHub, a folder with files, a wiki, etc. This utility allows the ease of use with a simple portal designed specifically for organizing code that generally has no other place to live. 

The idea behind Code Organizer is to have an easy to use, easy to search and easy to read site running locally (for your own repo) or on a server available for a team to use. There are 2 editions so please choose correctly when installing. If you want your own local repo or just want to demo the tool, choose the "local" version. If you have decided to use it for more people or a team of people, choose the "team" version. The difference is that the local version runs using localhost and a port number and the team version will run using a DNS name, SSL certificate and requires Entra ID setup for authentication. 

There is NO method of, or WILL EVER be added, the ability to store or use passwords or credentials in this tool. You should never, EVER, store passwords or credentials in a script itself. There are many ways to pass that information into a script at run time. You have been warned.

This tool is a repository only. You cannot run the code stored here from the site itself.
